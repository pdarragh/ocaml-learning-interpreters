# Interpreter 1

This is a simple interpreter with:

  * integers
  * variables
  * addition
  * multiplication
  * top-level functions (and application)

Its design and implementation are adapted from [the first skeleton interpreter
given](https://my.eng.utah.edu/~cs3520/f20/function2.rkt) in [the Fall 2020
incarnation](https://my.eng.utah.edu/~cs3520/f20/) of Matthew Flatt's
undergraduate/graduate programming languages course.
